# Cape-Floristic-Region-GEDIL2B-Map
 This program uses the GEDIL2B tutorial from https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/resources/e-learning/getting-started-gedi-l2b-data-python/. I changed the GeoJSON and GEDI files to analyze the Cape Floristic Region in South Africa. The visualized data displays canopy height, elevation, and PAI beams for the region.
