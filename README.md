# Cape-Floristic-Region-GEDIL2B-Map
 This program uses the GEDIL2B tutorial from https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/resources/e-learning/getting-started-gedi-l2b-data-python/. I changed the GeoJSON and GEDI files to analyze the Cape Floristic Region in South Africa. The visualized data displays canopy height, elevation, and PAI beams for the region.
 The GEDI L2B file can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQm7m8agnTKPynzI8VrMjcpFrY3Thr3U/view?usp=sharing
